1. In your projects, how did you organize your React application structure?
2. can you explain the Folder structure or design patterns you followed?
3. can you explain how you managed scalability and maintainability?
4. When did you decide to use Redux over Context API?
5. Can you walk me through a typical flow â€” from dispatching an action to updating the UI?
6. Can you give me a real scenario where you applied 
    - React.Memo and useMemo ?
    - Lazy loading (React.lazy, Suspense)
  And how it impacted your app?
7. Imagine your designer gives you a card component like a loan summary card, used across the app in 5+ places but with slight variations (e.g., some with icons, some with buttons, some read-only).
  How would you design this component to be:
  - Reusable
  - Customizable via props or composition
  - Easy to test and maintain?
