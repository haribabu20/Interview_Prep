ðŸ“¦ Why Use max-w-sm?

Without it, your card could stretch across the whole page (especially on large screens). max-w-sm prevents that and keeps the card at a reasonable width, making it:
  Easier to read
  Visually balanced
  Mobile-friendly

  Ex:
    <div className='bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg max-w-sm'>

    This means,
      The card will never exceed 384px(max-w-sms) in width.
      It will still be responsive â€” it can shrink on smaller screens, but wonâ€™t stretch too wide.
