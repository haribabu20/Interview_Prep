/*
âœ… What it Means:

  Badge: 
    A small label or tag â€” like you see on websites next to "New", "Active", "Sale", etc.
  Colored background: 
    The badge should have a background color (like green, red, blue...).
  Small text: 
    The text inside the badge should be small in size.


âœ… You are supposed to create:
    A small UI piece (component) that shows something like:
ðŸŸ© "New"
ðŸ”´ "Error"
ðŸŸ¦ "Info"

All styled using Tailwind CSS.
